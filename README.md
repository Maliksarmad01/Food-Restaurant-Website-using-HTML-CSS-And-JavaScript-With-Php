# Food Website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

This is a Food Restaurant-based website designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for backend processing, with PhpMyAdmin (XAMPP) used for database management.

## Restaurant Website

This project is a comprehensive and visually engaging restaurant website designed to showcase the food, ambiance, and services provided by a restaurant or food business. It consists of multiple sections and functionalities aimed at delivering an interactive and user-friendly experience to visitors. The website includes essential pages like the homepage, about page, menu page, and a contact form with server-side functionality.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is fully functional and visually appealing across different devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Interactive Menu**: A dynamic food menu with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and easy navigation, encouraging visitors to explore the restaurant’s offerings.
- **Contact Form with Backend Integration**: A PHP-based contact form that allows customers to send messages directly to the restaurant. This is ideal for reservation requests or inquiries.
- **Modern User Interface**: Clean and minimal design focused on user experience, with intuitive navigation and clear call-to-actions.
- **Multi-Page Layout**: The website includes multiple pages for different purposes—each with its own dedicated content and styling.

## Project Structure and Explanation

### HTML Pages

- **`index.html` (Homepage)**: 
  - The main landing page of the website. It includes a welcoming section, featured dishes, links to other pages, and a short overview of the restaurant. The homepage is designed to capture attention with large visuals and easy-to-read content.
  - Common sections:
    - **Hero Section**: A large, visually compelling banner image with a headline.
    - **Featured Dishes**: Highlights popular items from the menu, encouraging users to explore more.
    - **Navigation Bar**: Includes links to the About, Menu, and Contact pages.

- **`about.html` (About Us)**: 
  - Provides a deeper look into the restaurant’s mission, history, team, and values. This page focuses on building a personal connection with visitors by telling the story behind the restaurant.
  - May include a section on the chef's biography, restaurant awards, or customer testimonials.

- **`menu.html` (Menu)**: 
  - Displays a categorized food and drinks menu. This page organizes the restaurant’s offerings into logical sections (e.g., starters, main courses, desserts) with detailed descriptions and high-resolution images.
  - Features:
    - **Interactive Menu**: Users can browse through the food items easily. Dishes are accompanied by mouth-watering images.
    - **Pricing**: Prices are clearly displayed for each dish.

- **`contact.html` (Contact Us)**: 
  - A contact form where users can send messages directly to the restaurant. The form captures details like name, email, and message content.
  - This page includes a Google Maps integration to show the restaurant's location (optional).
  - **Form Processing**: The contact form data is handled by `contact.php`, ensuring that inquiries are sent to the specified email.

### CSS Files

- **`styles.css`**: The main stylesheet that applies global styles to all HTML pages. It sets up the base layout, typography, color schemes, and global design elements.
- **`about.css`**: Custom styles for the About page, including layout adjustments and unique section designs.
- **`contact.css`**: Styles for the contact page, including input fields, form layout, and button styling.
- **`menu.css`**: Specialized styles for the menu page, ensuring proper formatting of menu items, images, and categories.

### JavaScript

- **`scripts.js`**: Custom JavaScript to add interactivity to the website. This may include form validation, smooth scrolling, responsive menu toggles, or any other dynamic elements on the pages.

### PHP

- **`contact.php`**: The backend script that processes form submissions from the contact page. It captures user input (name, email, message), performs basic validation, and sends the data to the restaurant’s email address or saves it to a database (depending on server configuration).
  - **Security Note**: Ensure proper validation and sanitation of user input to prevent security issues like SQL injection or email header injection.

### Image Assets

- A large collection of food and restaurant images is used throughout the website to enhance the user experience. These include images of popular dishes (e.g., sushi, burgers, mac and cheese) and restaurant interiors (e.g., dining spaces, kitchen staff).
- Images are used to create an immersive atmosphere, allowing customers to visually explore the dining experience.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:
   - Open the project folder in an IDE (e.g., VSCode), and run the files using extensions like "Go Live."

2. **Ensure Proper File Structure**:
   - Make sure the pictures and media files are located in the same folder as the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files.

3. **Set Up Backend Server**:
   - Use **XAMPP** (or similar) as the backend server for PHP. Ensure that the file paths are correct according to your machine's directory structure.

### PHP Contact Form Setup

- To make the contact form functional, run the project on a PHP-enabled server (e.g., XAMPP with PHP).
- Configure the `contact.php` file with your desired settings to receive form submissions.

## Technologies Used
